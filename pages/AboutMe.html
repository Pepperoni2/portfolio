            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I’m Florian Golubic, a Creative Computing student at the University of Applied Sciences in St.
                Pölten. I’ve always been passionate about building websites, experimenting with various frameworks and
                programming languages to sharpen my skills.
                Although I'm still exploring my niche, I’m diving into different creative fields to discover where I
                truly belong.
                Over the past year, I gained hands-on experience as a Full-stack Developer, where I worked for about a
                year and a half. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and exploring new tools and techniques to create
                modern websites and innovative applications.As I continue developing my skills, I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
                Feel free to reach out for collaboration or project discussions!

                    <h2>2017-2022</h2>
                    <p>
                        I pursued my studies in Electronics and Computer Science at the Higher Technical College of
                        Moedling
                        in Lower Austria.<br>
                        During this time, I built a foundation in several programming languages, including C, C++, and
                        C#. I
                        also learned to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>

                        For my diploma thesis, I developed both the front-end and back-end of a dynamic ticket-shop
                        website.
                        This experience ignited my passion for full-stack web development and inspired my interest in
                        creative technology solutions.

                    <h2>2023-2024</h2>
                    <p>A few months after graduating, I began working as a Full-stack Developer at a small company in
                        Vienna, where I spent about a year and a half.<br>

                        There, I gained hands-on experience and refined my programming skills while also picking up new
                        languages and frameworks, such as Delphi, Laravel, and VueJS.<br>

                        This role provided valuable insight into the intricacies of developing complex programs and web
                        applications, deepening my understanding of both front-end and back-end development.

                    <p>
                        I am currently studying Creative Computing at the University of Applied Sciences in St. Pölten.<br>

                        The program centers on game development, design, and web development—along with many other
                        exciting
                        areas—making it an ideal fit as I work toward a career in these fields.<br>

                        Ultimately, I hope to pursue opportunities in this industry, possibly as a freelancer.
